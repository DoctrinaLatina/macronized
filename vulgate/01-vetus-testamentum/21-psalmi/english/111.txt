Alleluia. Of the returning of Aggeus and Zacharias: Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord; in his commandments  he shall delight exceedingly.
His seed shall be mighty upon earth; the generation of the righteous shall be blessed.
Glory and wealth shall be in his house, and his justice remaineth for ever and ever.
To the righteous a light is risen up in darkness; he is merciful, and compassionate, and just.
Acceptable is the man that showeth mercy and lendeth; he shall order his words with judgment,
because he shall not be moved for ever.
The just shall be in everlasting remembrance; he shall not fear an evil tiding; his heart is ready to hope in the Lord.
His heart is strengthened; he shall not be moved until he look over his enemies.
He hath distributed, he hath given to the poor; his justice remaineth for ever and ever; his horn shall be exalted in glory.
The wicked shall see, and shall be angry, he shall gnash with his teeth and pine away; the desire of the wicked shall perish.
