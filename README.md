# MACRONIZED

A collection of Latin text notated with macrons to mark vowel quality. The text
itself is stored in plain `.txt` files and can be consumed by other applications
to produce higher level documents.

## LaTeX Support

LaTeX is supported by this repository to produce PDFs that can be printed by
home-printers or submitted to publishers to produce books. Scripts to build
PDFs can be found in the `scripts` directory; these depend on having `bash` and
`xelatex` installed on your system.
