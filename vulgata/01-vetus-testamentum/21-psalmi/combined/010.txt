In Dominō confīdō; quōmodo dīcitis animae meae: Transmigrā in montem sīcut passer?^In the Lord I put my trust; how then do you say to my soul: Get thee away from hence to the mountain, like a sparrow.
Quoniam ecce peccātōrēs intendērunt arcum; parāvērunt sagittās suās in faretrā, ut sagittent in obscūrō rēctōs corde.^For behold the wicked have bent their bow; they have prepared their arrows in the quiver, to shoot in the dark the upright of heart;
Quoniam quae perfēcistī, dēstrūxērunt; jūstus autem, quid fēcit?^For the things which thou hast perfected, they destroyed; but what has the just man done?
Dominus in templō sānctō suō; Dominus in caelō sēdis ejus. Oculī ejus in pauperem respiciunt; palpebrae ejus interrogant fīliōs hominum.^The Lord is in his holy temple, the Lord's throne is in heaven. His eyes look on the poor man; his eyelids examine the sons of men.
Dominus interrogat jūstum et impium; quī autem dīligit inīquitātem, ōdit animam suam.^The Lord trieth the just and the wicked; but he that loveth iniquity, hateth his own soul.
Pluet super peccātōrēs laqueōs; ignis et sulfur, et spīritūs procellārum, pars calicis eōrum.^He shall rain snares upon sinners; fire and brimstone, and storms of winds, shall be the portion of their cup.
Quoniam jūstus Dominus, et jūstitiās dīlēxit; aequitātem vīdit vultus ejus.^For the Lord is just, and hath loved justice; his countenance hath beheld righteousness.
