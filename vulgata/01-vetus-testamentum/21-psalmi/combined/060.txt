Exaudī, Deus, dēprecātiōnem meam; intende ōrātiōnī meae.^Hear, O God, my supplication; be attentive to my prayer.
Ā fīnibus terrae ad tē clāmāvī; dum ānxiārētur cor meum, in petrā exaltāstī mē. Dēdūxistī mē,^To thee have I cried from the ends of the earth; when my heart was in anguish, thou hast exalted me on a rock. Thou hast conducted me,
quia factus es spēs mea; turris fortitūdinis ā faciē inimīcī.^For thou hast been my hope; a tower of strength against the face of the enemy.
Inhabitābō in tabernāculō tuō in saecula; prōtegar in vēlāmentō ālārum tuārum.^In thy tabernacle I shall dwell for ever; I shall be protected under the covert of thy wings.
Quoniam tū, Deus meus, exaudīvistī ōrātiōnem meam; dedistī hērēditātem timentibus nōmen tuum.^For thou, my God, hast heard my prayer; thou hast given an inheritance to them that fear thy name.
Diēs super diēs rēgis adjiciēs; annōs ejus usque in diem generātiōnis et generātiōnis.^Thou wilt add days to the days of the king; his years even to generation and generation.
Permanet in aeternum in conspectū Deī; misericordiam et vēritātem ejus quis requīret?^He abideth for ever in the sight of God; his mercy and truth who shall search?
Sīc psalmum dīcam nōminī tuō in saeculum saeculī, ut reddam vōta mea dē diē in diem.^So will I sing a psalm to thy name for ever and ever, that I may pay my vows from day to day.
