Domine, quid multiplicātī sunt quī trībulant mē? Multī insurgunt adversum mē.^Why, O Lord, are they multiplied that afflict me? many are they who rise up against me.
Multī dīcunt animae meae: Nōn est salūs ipsī in Deō ejus.^Many say to my soul: There is no salvation for him in his God.
Tū autem, Domine, susceptor meus es, glōria mea, et exaltans caput meum.^But thou, O Lord, art my protector, my glory, and the lifter up of my head.
Vōce meā ad Dominum clāmāvī, et exaudīvit mē dē monte sanctō suō.^I have cried to the Lord with my voice, and he hath heard me from his holy hill.
Ego dormīvī et sopōrātus sum, et exsurrēxī, quia Dominus suscēpit mē.^I have slept and have taken my rest, and I have risen up, because the Lord hath protected me.
Nōn timēbō mīllia populī circumdantīs mē. Exsurge Domine; salvum mē fac Deus meus.^I will not fear thousands of the people surrounding me. Arise, O Lord; save me, O my God.
Quoniam tū percussistī omnēs adversantēs mihī sine causā; dentēs peccātōrum contrīvistī.^For thou hast struck all them who are my adversaries without cause; thou hast broken the teeth of sinners.
Dominī est salūs, et super populum tuum benedictiō tua.^Salvation is of the Lord, and thy blessing is upon thy people.
