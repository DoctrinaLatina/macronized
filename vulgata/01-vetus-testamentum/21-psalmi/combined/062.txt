Deus, Deus meus, ad tē dē lūce vigilō. Sitīvit in tē anima mea, quam multipliciter tibī carō mea, in terrā dēsertā et inviā et inaquōsā.^O God, my God, to thee from the dawn do I keep watch. My soul hath thirsted for thee, how many ways to thee my flesh, in a deserted, trackless, waterless land. 
Sīc in sānctō appāruī tibī, ut vidērem virtūtem tuam et glōriam tuam.^So in the sanctuary have I come before thee, to see thy power and thy glory.
Quoniam melior est misericordia tua super vītās; labia mea laudābunt tē.^For thy mercy is better than lives; thee my lips will praise.
Sīc benedīcam tē in vītā meā, et in nōmine tuō levābō manūs meās.^Thus I will bless thee all my life long, and in thy name I will lift up my hands.
Sīcut adipe et pinguēdine repleātur anima mea, et labiīs exsultātiōnis laudābit ōs meum.^Let my soul be filled as with marrow and fatness, and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips.
Sī memor fuī tuī super strātum meum, in mātūtīnīs meditābor in tē.^If I have remembered thee upon my bed, I will meditate on thee in the morning.
quia fuistī adjūtor meus, et in vēlāmentō ālārum tuārum exsultābō.^Because thou hast been my helper, and I will rejoice under the cover of thy wings.
Adhaesit anima mea post tē; mē suscēpit dextera tua.^My soul hath stuck close to thee; thy right hand hath received me.
Ipsī vērō in vānum quaesīvērunt animam meam, introībunt in inferiōra terrae;^But they have sought my soul in vain, they shall go into the lower parts of the earth;
trādentur in manūs gladiī, partēs vulpium erunt.^they shall be delivered into the hands of the sword, they shall be the portions of foxes.
Rēx vērō laetābitur in Deō; laudābuntur omnēs quī jūrant in eō, quia obstrūctum est ōs loquentium inīqua.^But the king shall rejoice in God; all they shall be praised that swear by him, because the mouth is stopped of them that speak wicked things.
