Dominus rēgnāvit, decōrem indūtus est; indūtus est Dominus fortitūdinem, et praecīnxit sē. Etenim firmāvit orbem terrae, quī nōn commovēbitur.^The Lord hath reigned, he is clothed with beauty; the Lord is clothed with strength, and hath girded himself. For he hath established the world which shall not be moved.
Parāta sēdēs tua ex tunc; ā saeculō tū es.^My throne is prepared from of old; thou art from everlasting.
Ēlevāvērunt flūmina, Domine, ēlevāvērunt flūmina vōcem suam; ēlevāvērunt flūmina flūctūs suōs,^The floods have lifted up, O Lord, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods have lifted up their waves,
ā vōcibus aquārum multārum. Mīrābilēs ēlātiōnēs maris; mīrābilis in altīs Dominus.^with the noise of many waters. Wonderful are the exaltations of the sea; wonderful is the Lord on high.
Testimōnia tua crēdibilia facta sunt nimis; domum tuam decet sanctitūdō, Domine, in longitūdinem diērum.^Thy testimonies are become exceedingly credible; holiness becometh thy house, O Lord, unto length of days.
