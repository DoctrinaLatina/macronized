Inclīnā ad mē aurem tuam; accelerā ut ēruās mē. Estō mihī in Deum prōtectōrem, et in domum refugiī, ut salvum mē faciās,^Bow down thy ear to me; make haste to deliver me. Be thou unto me a protector God, and a house of refuge, to save me.
quoniam fortitūdō mea et refugium meum es tū, et propter nōmen tuum dēdūcēs mē et ēnūtriēs mē.^for thou art my strength and my refuge, and for thy name's sake thou wilt lead me and nourish me.
Ēdūcēs mē dē laqueō hōc quem abscondērunt mihī, quoniam tū es prōtector meus.^Thou wilt bring me out of this snare which they have hidden for me, for thou art my protector.
In manūs tuās commendō spīritum meum; redēmistī mē, Domine, Deus vēritātis.^Into thy hands I commend my spirit; thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, the God of truth.
Ōdistī observantēs vānitātēs supervacuē; ego autem in Dominō spērāvī.^Thou hast hated them that regard vanities to no purpose; but I have hoped in the Lord.

Nec conclūsistī mē in manibus inimīcī; statuistī in locō spatiōsō pedēs meōs.^And thou hast not shut me up in the hands of the enemy; thou hast set my feet in a spacious place.
Miserēre meī, Domine, quoniam trībulor; conturbātus est in īrā oculus meus, anima mea, et venter meus.^Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am afflicted; my eye is troubled with wrath, my soul, and my belly.

Illūstrā faciem tuam super servum tuum; salvum mē fac in misericordiā tuā.^Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; save me in thy mercy.
Domine, nōn confundar, quoniam invocāvī tē. Ērubēscant impiī, et dēdūcantur in infernum.^O Lord, let me not be confounded, for I have called upon thee. Let the wicked be ashamed, and be brought down to hell.
Mūta fīant labia dolōsa, quae loquuntur adversus jūstum inīquitātem, in superbiā, et in abūsiōne.^Let deceitful lips be made dumb, which speak iniquity against the just, with pride, and with abuse.

Dīligite Dominum, omnēs sanctī ejus, quoniam vēritātem requīret Dominus, et retribuet abundanter facientibus superbiam.^O love the Lord, all ye his saints, for the Lord will require truth, and will repay them abundantly that act proudly.
Virīliter agite, et confortētur cor vestrum, omnēs quī spērātis in Dominō.^Do ye manfully, and let your heart be strengthened, all ye that hope in the Lord.
