Ecce quam bonum et quam jūcundum habitāre frātrēs in ūnum.^Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.
Sīcut unguentum in capite, quod dēscendit in barbam, barbam Aarōnis, Quod dēscendit in ōram vestīmentī ejus;^Like the precious ointment on the head, that ran down upon the beard, the beard of Aaron, Which ran down to the skirt of his garment;
sīcut rōs Hermōn, quī dēscendit in montem Siōn. Quoniam illīc mandāvit Dominus benedictiōnem, et vītam usque in saeculum.^as the dew of Hermon, which descendeth upon mount Sion. For there the Lord hath commanded blessing, and life for evermore.
