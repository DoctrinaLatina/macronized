Domine, Deus salūtis meae, in diē clāmāvī, et nocte cōram tē.^O Lord, the God of my salvation, by day I cried out, and at night before thee.
Intret in conspectū tuō ōrātiō mea; inclīnā aurem tuam ad precem meam,^Let my prayer come in before thee; incline thy ear to my petition,
quia replēta est malīs anima mea, et vīta mea infernō adpropinquāvit.^for my soul is filled with evils, and my life hath drawn nigh to hell.
Aestimātus sum cum dēscendentibus in lacum; factus sum sīcut homō sine adjūtōriō,^I am counted among them that go down to the pit; I am become as a man without help,
inter mortuōs līber, Sīcut vulnerātī dormientēs in sepulchrīs, quōrum nōn es memor amplius, et ipsī dē manū tuā repulsī sunt.^free among the dead, like the slain sleeping in the sepulchres, whom thou rememberest no more, and they are cut off from thy hand.
Posuērunt mē in lacū inferiōrī, in tenebrōsīs, et in umbrā mortis.^They have laid me in the lower pit, in the dark places, and in the shadow of death.
Super mē confirmātus est furor tuus, et omnēs flūctūs tuōs indūxistī super mē.^Thy wrath is strong over me, and all thy waves thou hast brought in upon me.
Longē fēcistī nōtōs meōs ā mē; posuērunt mē abōminātiōnem sibī. Trāditus sum, et nōn ēgrediēbar;^Thou hast put away my acquaintance far from me; they have set me an abomination to themselves. I was delivered up, and came not forth;
oculī meī languērunt prae inopiā. Clāmāvī ad tē Domine tōtā diē; expandī ad tē manūs meās.^my eyes languished through poverty. All the day I cried to thee, O Lord; I stretched out my hands to thee.
Numquid mortuīs faciēs mīrābilia? Aut medicī suscitābunt, et confitēbuntur tibī?^Wilt thou show wonders to the dead? Or shall physicians raise to life, and give praise to thee?
Numquid narrābit aliquis in sepulchrō misericordiam tuam, et vēritātem tuam in perditiōne?^Shall any one in the sepulchre declare thy mercy, and thy truth in destruction?
Numquid cognōscentur in tenebrīs mīrābilia tua? Et jūstitia tua in terrā oblīviōnis?^Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? And thy justice in the land of forgetfulness?
Et ego ad tē, Domine, clāmāvī, et māne ōrātiō mea praeveniet tē.^But I, O Lord, have cried to thee, and in the morning my prayer shall prevent thee.
Ut quid Domine repellis ōrātiōnem meam; āvertis faciem tuam ā mē?^Lord, why castest thou off my prayer; why turnest thou away thy face from me?
Pauper sum ego, et in labōribus ā juventūte meā; exaltātus autem, humiliātus sum et conturbātus.^I am poor, and in labours from my youth; and being exalted, have been humbled and troubled.
In mē transīvērunt īrae tuae, et terrōrēs tuī conturbāvērunt mē.^Thy wrath hath come upon me, and thy terrors have troubled me.
Circumdedērunt mē sīcut aqua tōtā diē; circumdedērunt mē simul.^They have come round about me like water all the day; they have compassed me about together.
Ēlongāstī ā mē amīcum et proximum, et nōtōs meōs ā miseriā.^Friend and neighbour thou hast put far from me, and my acquaintance because of misery.
