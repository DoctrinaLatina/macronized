Quī confīdunt in Dominō, sīcut mōns Siōn; nōn commovēbitur in aeternum, quī habitat in Jerusalem.^They that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Sion; he shall not be moved for ever, he who dwelleth in Jerusalem.
Montēs in circumitū ejus, et Dominus in circumitū populī suī, ex hōc nunc et usque in saeculum.^Mountains are round about it, and the Lord is round about his people, from henceforth now and for ever.
Quia nōn relinquet Dominus virgam peccātōrum super sortem jūstōrum, ut nōn extendant jūstī ad inīquitātem manūs suās.^For the Lord will not leave the rod of sinners upon the lot of the just, that the just may not stretch forth their hands to iniquity.
Benefac, Domine, bonīs, et rēctīs corde.^Do good, O Lord, to those that are good, and to the upright of heart.
Dēclīnantēs autem in obligātiōnēs, addūcet Dominus cum operantibus inīquitātem. Pāx super Isrāhēl.^But such as turn aside into bonds, the Lord shall lead out with the workers of iniquity. Peace upon Israel.
