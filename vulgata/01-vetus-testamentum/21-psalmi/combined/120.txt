Levāvī oculōs meōs in montēs, unde veniet auxilium mihī.^I have lifted up my eyes to the mountains, from whence help shall come to me.
Auxilium meum ā Dominō, quī fēcit caelum et terram.^My help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
Nōn det in commōtiōnem pedem tuum, neque dormītet quī cūstōdit tē.^May he not suffer thy foot to be moved, neither let him slumber that keepeth thee.
Ecce nōn dormītābit neque dormiet quī cūstōdit Isrāhēl.^Behold he shall neither slumber nor sleep that keepeth Israel.
Dominus cūstōdit tē, Dominus prōtēctiō tua super manum dexteram tuam.^The Lord is thy keeper, the Lord is thy protection upon thy right hand.
Per diem sōl nōn ūret tē, neque lūna per noctem.^The sun shall not burn thee by day, nor the moon by night.
Dominus cūstōdit tē ab omnī malō; cūstōdiat animam tuam Dominus.^The Lord keepeth thee from all evil; may the Lord keep thy soul.
Dominus cūstōdiat introitum tuum, et exitum tuum, ex hōc nunc, et usque in saeculum.^May the Lord keep thy coming in and thy going out, from henceforth now and for ever.
