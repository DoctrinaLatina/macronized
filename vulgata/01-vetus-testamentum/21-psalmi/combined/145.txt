Laudā, anima mea, Dominum.^Praise the Lord, O my soul.
Laudābō Dominum in vītā meā; psallam Deō meō quamdiū fuerō.^I will praise the Lord in my life; I will sing to my God as long as I shall be.
Nōlīte confīdere in prīncipibus, in fīliīs hominum, in quibus nōn est salūs.^Put not your trust in princes, in the children of men, in whom there is no salvation.
Exībit spīritus ejus, et revertētur in terram suam; in illā diē perībunt omnēs cōgitātiōnēs eōrum.^His spirit shall go forth, and he shall return into his earth; in that day all their thoughts shall perish.
Beātus cuijus Deus Jācob adjūtor ejus, spēs ejus in Dominō Deō ipsīus,^Blessed is he who hath the God of Jacob for his helper, whose hope is in the Lord his God,
quī fēcit caelum et terram, mare, et omnia quae in eīs sunt, quī cūstōdit vēritātem in saeculum,^who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all things that are in them; who keepeth truth for ever,
facit jūdicium injūriam patientibus, dat ēscam ēsurientibus. Dominus solvit compedītōs;^who executeth judgment for them that suffer wrong, who giveth food to the hungry. The Lord looseth them that are fettered;
Dominus illūminat caecōs; Dominus ērigit ēlīsōs; Dominus dīligit jūstōs.^the Lord enlighteneth the blind; the Lord lifteth up them that are cast down; the Lord loveth the just.
Dominus cūstōdit advenās; pūpillum et viduam suscipiet, et viās peccātōrum disperdet.^The Lord keepeth the strangers; he will support the fatherless and the widow, and the ways of sinners he will destroy.
Rēgnābit Dominus in saecula; Deus tuus, Sīon, in generātiōnem et generātiōnem.^The Lord shall reign for ever; thy God, O Sion, unto generation and generation.
