Deus stetit in sinagōgā deōrum, in mediō autem deōs dījūdicat.^God hath stood in the congregation of gods, and being in the midst of them he judgeth gods.
Usquequō jūdicātis inīquitātem, et faciēs peccātōrum sūmitis?^How long will you judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked?
Jūdicāte egēnō et pūpillō; humilem et pauperem jūstificāte.^Judge for the needy and fatherless; do justice to the humble and the poor.
Ēripite pauperem, et egēnum dē manū peccātōris līberāte.^Rescue the poor, and deliver the needy out of the hand of the sinner.
Nescīvērunt, neque intellēxērunt; in tenebrīs ambulant; movēbuntur omnia fundāmenta terrae.^They have not known nor understood; they walk on in darkness; all the foundations of the earth shall be moved.
Ego dīxī: Deī estis, et fīliī excelsī omnēs.^I have said: You are gods and all of you the sons of the most High.
Vōs autem sīcut hominēs moriēminī, et sīcut ūnus dē prīncipibus cadētis.^But you like men shall die, and shall fall like one of the princes.
Surge, Deus, jūdicā terram, quoniam tū hērēditābis in omnibus gentibus.^Arise, O God, judge thou the earth, for thou shalt inherit among all the nations.
