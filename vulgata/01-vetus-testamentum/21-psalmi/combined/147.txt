Laudā, Jerusalem, Dominum; laudā Deum tuum, Sīon.^Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Sion.
Quoniam confortāvit serās portārum tuārum; benedīxit fīliīs tuīs in tē.^Because he hath strengthened the bolts of thy gates, he hath blessed thy children within thee.
Quī posuit fīnēs tuōs pācem, et adipe frūmentī satiat tē.^Who hath placed peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the fat of corn.
Quī ēmittit ēloquium suum terrae; vēlōciter currit sermō ejus.^Who sendeth forth his speech to the earth; his word runneth swiftly.
Quī dat nivem sīcut lānam; nebulam sīcut cinerem spargit.^Who giveth snow like wool; scattereth mists like ashes.
Mittit cristallum suum sīcut buccellās; ante faciem frīgoris ejus quis sustinēbit?^He sendeth his crystal like morsels; who shall stand before the face of his cold?
Ēmittet verbum suum, et liquefaciet ea; flābit spīritus ejus, et fluent aquae.^He shall send out his word, and shall melt them; his wind shall blow, and the waters shall run.
Quī adnūntiat verbum suum Jācōb; jūstitiās, et jūdicia sua Isrāhel.^Who declareth his word to Jacob; his justices and his judgments to Israel.
Nōn fēcit tāliter omnī nātiōnī, et jūdicia sua nōn manifestāvit eīs.^He hath not done in like manner to every nation, and his judgments he hath not made manifest to them.
