Dīxit Dominus Dominō meō: Sedē ā dextrīs meīs, dōnec pōnam inimīcōs tuōs scabellum pedum tuōrum.^The Lord said to my Lord: Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool.
Virgam virtūtis tuae ēmittet Dominus ex Sīon; domināre in mediō inimīcōrum tuōrum.^The Lord will send forth the sceptre of thy power out of Sion; rule thou in the midst of thy enemies.
Tēcum prīncipium in diē virtūtis tuae, in splendōribus sānctōrum; ex uterō ante lūciferum genuī tē.^With thee is the principality in the day of thy strength, in the brightness of the saints; from the womb before the day star I begot thee.
Jūrāvit Dominus et nōn poenitēbit eum: Tū es sacerdōs in aeternum secundum ōrdinem Melchisedech.^The Lord hath sworn and shall not repent: Thou art a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedech.
Dominus ā dextrīs tuīs; confrēgit in diē īrae suae rēgēs.^The Lord is at thy right hand; he hath broken kings in the day of his wrath.
Jūdicābit in nātiōnibus, implēbit ruīnās; conquassābit capita in terrā multōrum.^He shall judge among nations, he shall fill ruins; he shall crush the heads in the land of many.
Dē torrente in viā bibet; proptereā exaltābit caput.^He shall drink of the torrent in the way; therefore shall he lift up the head.
