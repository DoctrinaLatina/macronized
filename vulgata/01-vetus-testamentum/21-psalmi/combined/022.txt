Dominus regit mē, et nihil mihī dēerit.^The Lord ruleth me, and I shall want nothing.
In locō pāscuae ibī mē collocāvit; super aquam refectiōnis ēducāvit mē.^He hath set me in a place of pasture; he hath brought me up to the water of refreshment.
Animam meam convertit; dēdūxit mē super sēmitās jūstitiae, propter nōmen suum.^He hath converted my soul; he hath led me on the paths of justice, for his own name's sake.
Nam et sī ambulāverō in mediō umbrae mortis, nōn timēbō mala, quoniam tū mēcum es. Virga tua, et baculus tuus, ipsa mē consōlāta sunt.^For though I should walk in the midst of the shadow of death, I will fear no evils, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they have comforted me.
Parāstī in conspectū meō mēnsam, adversus eōs, quī trībulant mē. Impinguāstī in oleō caput meum, et calix meus inēbrians, quam praeclārus est.^Thou hast prepared a table before me against them that afflict me. Thou hast anointed my head with oil, and my chalice which inebreateth me, how excellent it is.
Et misericordia tua subsequētur mē omnibus diēbus vītae meae, et ut inhabitem in domō Dominī in longitūdinem diērum.^And thy mercy will follow me all the days of my life, and that I may dwell in the house of the Lord unto length of days.
