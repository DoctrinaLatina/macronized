Jūdicā mē Domine, quoniam ego in innocentiā meā ingressus sum, et in Dominō spērans nōn infirmābor.^Judge me, O Lord, for I have walked in my innocence, and I have put my trust in the Lord, and shall not be weakened.
Probā mē, Domine, et tentā mē; ūre rēnēs meōs et cor meum.^Prove me, O Lord, and try me; burn my reins and my heart.
Quoniam misericordia tua ante oculōs meōs est, et complacuī in vēritāte tuā.^For thy mercy is before my eyes, and I am well pleased with thy truth.
Nōn sēdī cum conciliō vānitātis, et cum inīqua gerentibus nōn introībō.^I have not sat with the council of vanity, and with the doers of unjust things I will not enter.
Ōdīvī ecclēsiam malignantium, et cum impiīs nōn sedēbō.^I have hated the assembly of the malignant; and with the wicked I will not sit.
Lavābō inter innocentēs manūs meās, et circumdabō altāre tuum Domine,^I will wash my hands among the innocent, and will compass thy altar, O Lord,
ut audiam vōcem laudis, et ēnarrem ūniversa mīrābilia tua.^that I may hear the voice of thy praise, and tell of all thy wondrous works.
Domine, dīlēxī decōrem domūs tuae, et locum habitātiōnis glōriae tuae.^I have loved, O Lord, the beauty of thy house, and the place where thy glory dwelleth.
Nē perdās cum impiīs Deus animam meam, et cum virīs sanguinum vītam meam,^Take not away my soul, O God, with the wicked; nor my life with bloody men,
In quōrum manibus inīquitātēs sunt; dextera eōrum replēta est mūneribus.^in whose hands are iniquities; their right hand is filled with bribes.
Ego autem in innocentiā meā ingressus sum; redime mē, et miserēre meī.^But as for me, I have walked in my innocence; redeem me, and have mercy on me.
Pēs meus stetit in dīrēctō; in ecclēsiīs benedīcam tē, Domine.^My foot hath stood in the direct way; in the churches I will bless thee, O Lord.
