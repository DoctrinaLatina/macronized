Miserēre meī, Deus, quoniam conculcāvit mē homō; tōtā diē impugnans trībulāvit mē.^Have mercy on me, O God, for man hath trodden me under foot; all the day long he hath afflicted me fighting against me.
Conculcāvērunt mē inimīcī meī tōtā diē; quoniam multī bellantēs adversum mē.^My enemies have trodden on me all the day long; for they are many that make war against me.
Ab altitūdine diēī timēbō, ego vērō in tē spērābō.^From the height of the day I shall fear, but I will trust in thee.
In Deō laudābō sermōnēs meōs, in Deō spērāvī; nōn timēbō quid faciat mihī cārō.^In God I will praise my words, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do against me.
Tōtā diē verba mea exsecrābantur; adversum mē omnēs cōgitātiōnēs eōrum in malum.^All the day long they detested my words; all their thoughts were against me unto evil.
Inhabitābunt, et abscondent; ipsī calcāneum meum observābunt. Sīcut sustinuērunt animam meam,^They will dwell and hide themselves; they will watch my heel. As they have waited for my soul,
prō nihilō salvōs faciēs illōs; in īrā populōs confringēs, Deus.^for nothing shalt thou save them; in thy anger thou shalt break the people in pieces. O God,
Vītam meam adnūntiāvī tibī; posuistī lacrimās meās in conspectū tuō, sīcut et in prōmissiōne tuā;^I have declared to thee my life; thou hast set me tears in thy sight, as also in thy promise;
tunc convertentur inimīcī meī retrōrsum. In quācumque diē invocāverō tē, ecce cognōvī quoniam Deus meus es.^then shall my enemies be turned back. In what day soever I shall call upon thee, behold I know thou art my God.
In Deō laudābō verbum; in Dominō laudābō sermōnem. In Deō spērāvī; nōn timēbō quid faciat mihī homō.^In God will I praise the word; in the Lord will I praise his speech. In God have I hoped; I will not fear what man can do to me.
In mē sunt, Deus, vōta tua, quae reddam, laudātiōnēs tibī,^In me, O God, are vows to thee, which I will pay, praises to thee,
quoniam ēripuistī animam meam dē morte, et pedēs meōs dē lāpsū, ut placeam cōram Deō in lūmine vīventium.^because thou hast delivered my soul from death, my feet from falling, that I may please in the sight of God, in the light of the living.
