Dīlēxī, quoniam exaudiet Dominus vōcem ōrātiōnis meae.^I have loved, because the Lord will hear the voice of my prayer.
Quia inclīnāvit aurem suam mihī, et in diēbus meīs invocābō.^Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, and in my days I will call upon him.
Circumdedērunt mē dolōrēs mortis, et perīcula infernī invēnērunt mē; trībulātiōnem et dolōrem invēnī,^The sorrows of death have compassed me, and the perils of hell have found me; I met with trouble and sorrow,
et nōmen Dominī invocāvī; Ō Domine, līberā animam meam.^and I called upon the name of the Lord; O Lord, deliver my soul.
Misericors Dominus, et jūstus, et Deus noster miserētur.^Merciful is the Lord, and just, and our God showeth mercy.
Cūstōdiens parvulōs Dominus; humiliātus sum, et līberāvit mē.^The Lord is the keeper of little ones; I was humbled, and he delivered me.
Convertere, anima mea, in requiem tuam, quia Dominus benefēcit tibī.^Turn, O my soul, into thy rest, for the Lord hath been bountiful to thee.
Quia ēripuit animam meam dē morte, oculōs meōs ā lacrimīs, pedēs meōs ā lāpsū.^For he hath delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from falling.
Placēbō Dominō in regiōne vīvōrum.^I will please the Lord in the land of the living.
