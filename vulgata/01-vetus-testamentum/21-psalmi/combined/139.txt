Ēripe mē Domine ab homine malō; ā virō inīquō ēripe mē.^Deliver me, O Lord, from the evil man; rescue me from the unjust man.
Quī cōgitāvērunt inīquitātēs in corde; tōtā diē constituēbant praelia.^Who have devised iniquities in their hearts; all the day long they designed battles.
Acuērunt linguās suās sīcut serpentis; venēnum aspidum sub labiīs eōrum.^They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; the venom of asps is under their lips.
Cūstōdī mē, Domine, dē manū peccātōris, et ab hominibus inīquīs ēripe mē, quī cōgitāvērunt supplantāre gressūs meōs.^Keep me, O Lord, from the hand of the wicked, and from unjust men deliver me, who have proposed to supplant my steps.
Abscondērunt superbī laqueum mihī, et fūnēs extendērunt in laqueum; jūxtā iter scandalum posuērunt mihī.^The proud have hidden a net for me, and they have stretched out cords for a snare; they have laid for me a stumblingblock by the wayside.
Dīxī Dominō: Deus meus es tū; exaudī, Domine, vōcem dēprecātiōnis meae.^I said to the Lord: Thou art my God; hear, O Lord, the voice of my supplication.
Domine, Domine, virtūs salūtis meae, obumbrāstī super caput meum in diē bellī.^O Lord, Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast overshadowed my head in the day of battle.
Nē trādās mē, Domine, ā dēsīderiō meō peccātōrī; cōgitāvērunt contrā mē; nē dērelinquās mē, nē forte exaltentur.^Give me not up, O Lord, from my desire to the wicked; they have plotted against me; do not thou forsake me, lest they should triumph.
Caput circumitūs eōrum; labor labiōrum ipsōrum operiet eōs.^The head of them compassing me about; the labour of their lips shall overwhelm them.
Cadent super eōs carbōnēs; in ignem dējiciēs eōs; in miseriīs nōn subsistent.^Burning coals shall fall upon them; thou wilt cast them down into the fire; in miseries they shall not be able to stand.
Vir linguōsus nōn dīrigētur in terrā; virum injūstum mala capient in interitū.^A man full of tongue shall not be established in the earth; evil shall catch the unjust man unto destruction.
