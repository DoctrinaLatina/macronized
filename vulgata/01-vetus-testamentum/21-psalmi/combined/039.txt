Expectans expectāvī Dominum, et intendit mihī.^With expectation I have waited for the Lord, and he was attentive to me.
Et exaudīvit precēs meās, et ēdūxit mē dē lacū miseriae et dē lutō faecis. Et statuit super petram pedēs meōs, et dīrēxit gressūs meōs.^And he heard my prayers, and brought me out of the pit of misery and the mire of dregs. And he set my feet upon a rock, and directed my steps.
Et immīsit in ōs meum canticum novum, carmen Deō nostrō. Vidēbunt multī, et timēbunt, et spērābunt in Dominō.^And he put a new canticle into my mouth, a song to our God. Many shall see, and shall fear, and they shall hope in the Lord.
Beātus vir cuijus est nōmen Dominī spēs ejus, et nōn respexit in vānitātēs et insāniās falsās.^Blessed is the man whose trust is in the name of the Lord, and who hath not had regard to vanities and lying follies.
Multa fēcistī tū, Domine Deus meus, mīrābilia tua, et cōgitātiōnibus tuīs nōn est quī similis sit tibī. Adnūntiāvī et locūtus sum; multiplicātī sunt super numerum.^Many things thou hast wrought, O Lord my God, thy wonderful works, and in thy thoughts there is no one like to thee. I have declared and I have spoken; they are multiplied above number.
Sacrificium et oblātiōnem nōluistī; aurēs autem perfēcistī mihī. Holocaustum et prō peccātō nōn postulāstī.^Sacrifice and oblation thou didst not desire; but thou hast perfected ears for me. Burnt offering and sin offering thou didst not require.
Tunc dīxī: Ecce veniō; in capite librī scrīptum est dē mē,^Then said I: Behold I come; in the head of the book it is written of me,
ut facerem voluntātem tuam; Deus meus, voluī, et lēgem tuam in mediō cordis meī.^that I should do thy will; O my God, I have desired it, and thy law in the midst of my heart.
Adnūntiāvī jūstitiam tuam in ecclēsiā magnā; ecce labia mea nōn prohibēbō; Domine, tū scīvistī.^I have declared thy justice in a great church; behold I will not restrain my lips; O Lord, thou knowest it.
Jūstitiam tuam nōn abscondī in corde meō; vēritātem tuam et salūtāre tuum dīxī. Nōn abscondī misericordiam tuam et vēritātem tuam ā conciliō multō.^I have not hid thy justice within my heart; I have declared thy truth and thy salvation. I have not concealed thy mercy and thy truth from a great council.
Tū autem, Domine, nē longē faciās miserātiōnēs tuās ā mē; misericordia tua et vēritās tua semper suscēpērunt mē.^Withhold not thou, O Lord, thy tender mercies from me; thy mercy and thy truth have always upheld me.
Quoniam circumdedērunt mē mala quōrum nōn est numerus; comprehendērunt mē inīquitātēs meae, et nōn potuī ut vidērem; multiplicātae sunt super capillōs capitis meī, et cor meum dērelīquit mē.^For evils without number have surrounded me; my iniquities have overtaken me, and I was not able to see; they are multiplied above the hairs of my head, and my heart hath forsaken me.
Complaceat tibī, Domine, ut ēruās mē; Domine, ad adjuvandum mē respice.^Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me. Look down, O Lord, to help me.
Confundantur et revereantur simul, quī quaerunt animam meam, ut auferant eam; convertantur retrōrsum et revereantur, quī volunt mihī mala.^Let them be confounded and ashamed together, who seek after my soul to take it away; let them be turned backward and be ashamed, who desire evils to me.
Ferant confestim confūsiōnem suam, quī dīcunt mihī: Eugē, eugē.^Let them immediately bear their confusion, that say to me: Well done, well done.
Exsultent et laetentur super tē omnēs quaerentēs tē, et dīcant semper: Magnificētur Dominus, quī dīligunt salūtāre tuum.^Let all that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee, and let them say always: The Lord be magnified, who love thy salvation.
Ego autem mendīcus sum et pauper; Dominus sollicitus est meī. Adjūtor meus et prōtēctor meus tū es; Deus meus, nē tardāverīs.^But I am a beggar and poor; the Lord is careful for me. Thou art my helper and my protector; O my God, make no tarrying.
