Nōnne Deō subiecta erit anima mea? Ab ipsō enim salūtāre meum.^Shall not my soul be subject to God? for from him is my salvation.
Nam et ipse Deus meus et salūtāris meus; susceptor meus, nōn movēbor amplius.^For he is my God and my saviour; he is my protector, I shall be moved no more.
Quousque irruitis in hominem? Interficitis ūniversī vōs, tamquam parietī inclīnātō et māceriae dēpulsae.^How long do you rush in upon a man? You all kill, as if you were thrusting down a leaning wall and a tottering fence.
Vērumtamen pretium meum cōgitāvērunt repellere; cucurrī in sitī; ōre suō benedīcēbant, et corde suō maledīcēbant.^But they have thought to cast away my price; I ran in thirst; they blessed with their mouth, but cursed with their heart.
Vērumtamen Deō subiecta estō, anima mea, quoniam ab ipsō patientia mea;^But truly be thou subject to God, O my soul, for from him is my patience.
quia ipse Deus meus et salvātor meus, adjūtor meus; nōn ēmigrābō.^For he is my God and my saviour, my helper; I shall not be moved.
In Deō salūtāre meum et glōria mea; Deus auxiliī meī, et spēs mea in Deō est.^In God is my salvation and my glory; he is the God of my help, and my hope is in God.
Spērāte in eō, omnis congregātiō populī; effundite cōram illō corda vestra; Deus adjūtor noster in aeternum.^Trust in him, all ye congregation of people; pour out your hearts before him; God is our helper for ever.
Vērumtamen vānī fīliī hominum, mendācēs fīliī hominum in statērīs, ut dēcipiant ipsī dē vānitāte in idipsum.^But vain are the sons of men, the sons of men are liars in the balances, that by vanity they may together deceive.
Nōlīte spērāre in inīquitāte, et rapīnās nōlīte concupīscere; dīvitiae sī affluant, nōlīte cor appōnere.^Trust not in iniquity, and covet not robberies; if riches abound, set not your heart upon them.
Semel locūtus est Deus, duo haec audīvī, quia potestās Deī est,^God hath spoken once, these two things have I heard, that power belongeth to God,
et tibī, Domine, misericordiā; quia tū reddēs ūnīcuique jūxtā opera sua.^And to thee, O Lord, mercy; for thou wilt render to every man according to his works.
