Beātus vir, quī nōn abīvit in consiliō impiōrum, et in viā peccātōrum nōn stetit, et in cathedrā pestilentiae nōn sēdit;^Blessed is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the chair of pestilence;
sed in lēge Dominī voluntās ejus, et in lēge ejus meditābitur diē ac nocte.^but his will is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he shall meditate day and night.
Et erit tamquam lignum quod plantātum est secus dēcursūs aquārum, quod frūctum suum dabit in tempore suō, et folium ejus nōn dēfluet. Et omnia quaecumque faciet prōsperābuntur.^And he shall be like a tree which is planted near the running waters, which shall bring forth its fruit in due season, and his leaf shall not fall off. And all whatsoever he shall do shall prosper.
Nōn sīc impiī, nōn sīc; sed tamquam pulvis, quem prōjicit ventus ā faciē terrae.^Not so the wicked, not so; but like the dust, which the wind driveth from the face of the earth.
Ideō nōn resurgent impiī in jūdiciō, neque peccātōrēs in conciliō jūstōrum;^Therefore the wicked shall not rise again in judgment, nor sinners in the council of the just;
quoniam nōvit Dominus viam jūstōrum, et iter impiōrum perībit.^for the Lord knoweth the way of the just, and the way of the wicked shall perish.
