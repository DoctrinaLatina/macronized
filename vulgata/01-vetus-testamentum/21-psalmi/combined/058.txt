Ēripe mē dē inimīcīs meīs, Deus meus, et ab insurgentibus in mē līberā mē.^Deliver me from my enemies, O my God, and from them that rise up against me free me.
Ēripe mē dē operantibus inīquitātem, et dē virīs sanguinum salvā mē.^Deliver me from them that work iniquity, and save me from bloody men.
Quia ecce cēpērunt animam meam; irruērunt in mē fortēs.^For behold they have caught my soul; the mighty have rushed in upon me.
Neque inīquitās mea, neque peccātum meum, Domine; sine inīquitāte cucurrī, et dīrēxī.^Neither is it my iniquity, nor my sin, O Lord; without iniquity have I run, and have I directed.
Exsurge in occursum meum, et vidē. Et tū, Domine, Deus virtūtum, Deus Isrāhēl, intende ad vīsitandās omnēs gentēs; nōn misereāris omnibus quī operantur inīquitātem.^Rise up thou to meet me, and behold. And thou, O Lord, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, attend to visit all the nations; have no mercy on all them that work iniquity.
Convertentur ad vesperam, et famem patientur ut canēs, et circumībunt cīvitātem.^They shall return at evening, and shall suffer hunger as dogs, and shall go round about the city.
Ecce loquentur in ōre suō, et gladius in labiīs eōrum; quoniam quis audīvit?^Behold they shall speak with their mouth, and a sword is in their lips; for who has heard?
Et tū, Domine, dērīdēbis eōs; ad nihilum dēdūcēs omnēs gentēs.^But thou, O Lord, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt bring all the nations to nothing.
Fortitūdinem meam ad tē cūstōdiam, quia Deus susceptor meus es.^I will keep my strength to thee, for thou art my protector
Deus meus, misericordia ejus praeveniet mē; Deus ostendet mihī super inimīcōs meōs.^My God, his mercy shall prevent me; God shall let me see over my enemies.
Nē occīdās eōs, nēquandō oblīvīscantur populī meī. Disperge illōs in virtūte tuā, et dēpōne eōs, prōtēctor meus, Domine,^Slay them not, lest at any time my people forget. Scatter them by thy power, and bring them down, my protector, O Lord,
dēlictum ōris eōrum, sermōnem labiōrum ipsōrum, et comprehendantur in superbiā suā. Et dē exsecrātiōne et mendāciō adnūntiābuntur,^a sin of their mouth, a word of their lips, and let them be taken in their pride. And for their cursing and lying they shall be talked of,
in consummātiōne, in īrā consummātiōnis, et nōn erunt. Et scient quia Deus dominābitur Jācōb, et fīnium terrae.^when they are consumed, when they are consumed by thy wrath, and they shall be no more. And they shall know that God will rule Jacob, and all the ends of the earth.
Convertentur ad vesperam, et famem patientur ut canēs, et circumībunt cīvitātem.^They shall return at evening, and shall suffer hunger as dogs, and shall go round about the city.
Ipsī dispergentur ad mandūcandum, sī vērō nōn fuerint saturātī, et murmurābunt.^They shall be scattered abroad to eat, if truely they shall not be filled, and shall murmur.
Ego autem cantābō fortitūdinem tuam, et exsultābō māne misericordiam tuam. Quia factus es susceptor meus, et refugium meum, in diē trībulātiōnis meae.^But I will sing thy strength, and will extol thy mercy in the morning. For thou art become my support, and my refuge, in the day of my trouble.
Adjūtor meus, tibī psallam, quia Deus susceptor meus es; Deus meus, misericordia mea.^O my helper, will unto thee will I sing, for thou art God my defence; my God, my mercy.
