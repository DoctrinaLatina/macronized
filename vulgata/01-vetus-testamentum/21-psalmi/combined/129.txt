Dē profundīs clāmāvī ad tē, Domine.^Out of the depths I have cried to thee, O Lord.
Domine, exaudī vōcem meam; fīant aurēs tuae intendentēs in vōcem dēprecātiōnis meae.^Lord, hear my voice; let thy ears be attentive to the voice of my supplication.
Sī inīquitātēs observāverīs, Domine, Domine, quis sustinēbit?^If thou, O Lord, wilt mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand it?
Quia apud tē propitiātiō est.^For with thee there is merciful forgiveness.
Propter lēgem tuam sustinuī tē, Domine; sustinuit anima mea in verbō ejus.^By reason of thy law, I have waited for thee, O Lord; my soul hath relied on his word.
Spērāvit anima mea in Dominō ā custōdiā mātūtīnā usque ad noctem; spēret Isrāhēl in Dominō.^My soul hath hoped in the Lord from the morning watch even until night; let Israel hope in the Lord.
Quia apud Dominum misericordia, et cōpiōsa apud eum redēmptiō.^Because with the Lord there is mercy, and with him plentiful redemption.
Et ipse redimet Isrāhēl ex omnibus inīquitātibus ejus.^And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
