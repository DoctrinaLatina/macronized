Venīte, exsultēmus Dominō; jūbilēmus Deō salūtārī nostrō;^Come, let us praise the Lord with joy; let us joyfully sing to God our saviour;
praeoccupēmus faciem ejus in confessiōne, et in psalmīs jūbilēmus eī;^let us come before his presence with thanksgiving; and make a joyful noise to him with psalms;
quoniam Deus magnus Dominus, et Rēx magnus super omnēs deōs.^for the Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods.
Quia in manū ejus sunt omnēs fīnēs terrae, et altitūdinēs montium ipsīus sunt;^For in his hand are all the ends of the earth, and the heights of the mountains are his;
quoniam ipsīus est mare, et ipse fēcit illud, et siccam manūs ejus fōrmāvērunt.^for the sea is his, and he made it, and his hands formed the dry land.
Venīte, adōrēmus et prōcidāmus, et plōrēmus ante Dominum quī fēcit nōs;^Come, let us adore and fall down, and weep before the Lord that made us;
quia ipse est Dominus Deus noster, et nōs populus pāscuae ejus, et ovēs manūs ejus.^for he is the Lord our God, and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand.
Hodiē sī vōcem ejus audīverītis, nōlīte obdūrāre corda vestra, sīcut in irrītātiōne, secundum diem tentātiōnis in dēsertō,^Today if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, according to the day of temptation in the wilderness,
ubī tentāvērunt mē pātrēs vestrī, probāvērunt mē, et vīdērunt opera mea.^where your fathers tempted me, they proved me, and saw my works.
Quadrāgintā annīs offensus fuī generātiōnī illī, et dīxī: Semper hī errant corde.^Forty years long was I offended with that generation, and I said: These always err in heart.
Et istī nōn cognōvērunt viās meās; ut jūrāvī in īrā meā: Sī introībunt in requiem meam.^And these men have not known my ways; so I swore in my wrath: They shall not enter into my rest.
