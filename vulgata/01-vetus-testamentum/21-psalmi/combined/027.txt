Ad tē, Domine, clāmābō; Deus meus, nē sileās ā mē, nē quandō taceās ā mē, et assimilābor dēscendentibus in lacum.^Unto thee, O Lord, will I cry; O my God, be not thou silent to me, lest if thou be silent to me, and I shall be like them that go down into the pit.
Exaudī, Domine, vōcem dēprecātiōnis meae dum ōrō ad tē; dum extollō manūs meās ad templum sanctum tuum.^Hear, O Lord, the voice of my supplication, when I pray to thee; when I lift up my hands to thy holy temple.
Nē simul trahās mē cum peccātōribus, et cum operantibus inīquitātem nē perdās mē; quī loquuntur pācem cum proximō suō, mala autem in cordibus eōrum.^Draw me not away together with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity destroy me not; who speak peace with their neighbour, but evils are in their hearts.
Dā illīs secundum opera eōrum, et secundum nēquitiam adinventiōnum ipsōrum. Secundum opera manuum eōrum tribue illīs; redde retribūtiōnem eōrum ipsīs.^Give them according to their works, and according to the wickedness of their inventions. According to the works of their hands give thou to them; render to them their reward.
Quoniam nōn intellēxērunt opera Dominī, et in opera manuum ejus; dēstruēs illōs, et nōn aedificābis eōs.^Because they have not understood the works of the Lord, and the operations of his hands; thou shalt destroy them, and shalt not build them up.
Benedictus Dominus, quoniam exaudīvit vōcem dēprecātiōnis meae.^Blessed be the Lord, for he hath heard the voice of my supplication.
Dominus adjūtor meus, et prōtector meus; in ipsō spērāvit cor meum et adjūtus sum, et reflōruit carō mea, et ex voluntāte meā confitēbor eī.^The Lord is my helper and my protector; in him hath my heart confided and I have been helped, and my flesh hath flourished again, and with my will I will give praise to him.
Dominus fortitūdō plēbis suae, et prōtector salvātiōnum chrīstī suī est.^The Lord is the strength of his people, and the protector of the salvation of his anointed.
Salvum fac populum tuum, Domine, et benedīce hērēditātī tuae, et rege eōs, et extolle illōs usque in aeternum.^Save thy people, O Lord, and bless thy inheritance, and rule them, and exalt them for ever.
