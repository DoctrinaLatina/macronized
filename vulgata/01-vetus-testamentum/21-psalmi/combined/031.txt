Beātī quōrum remissae sunt inīquitātēs, et quōrum tēcta sunt peccāta.^Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.
Beātus vir, cui nōn imputāvit Dominus peccātum, nec est in spīritū ejus dolus.^Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed sin, and in whose spirit there is no guile.
Quoniam tacuī, inveterāvērunt ossa mea, dum clāmārem tōtā diē.^Because I was silent my bones grew old; whilst I cried out all the day long.
Quoniam diē ac nocte gravāta est super mē manus tua, conversus sum in aerumnā meā, dum confīgitur spīna.^For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me; I am turned in my anguish, whilst the thorn is fastened.
Dēlictum meum cognitum tibī fēcī, et injūstitiam meam nōn abscondī. Dīxī: Confitēbor adversum mē injūstitiam meam Dominō. Et tū remīsistī impietātem peccātī meī.^I have acknowledged my sin to thee, and my injustice I have not concealed. I said: I will confess against my self my injustice to the Lord. And thou hast forgiven the wickedness of my sin.
Prō hāc ōrābit ad tē omnis sānctus in tempore opportūnō. Vērumtamen in dīluviō aquārum multārum, ad eum nōn approximābunt.^For this shall every one that is holy pray to thee in a seasonable time. And yet in a flood of many waters, they shall not come nigh unto him.
Tū es refugium meum ā trībulātiōne quae circumdedit mē; exsultātiō mea, ērue mē ā circumdantibus mē.^Thou art my refuge from the trouble which hath encompassed me; my joy, deliver me from them that surround me.
Intellēctum tibī dabō, et instruam tē in viā hāc quā gradiēris; firmābō super tē oculōs meōs.^I will give thee understanding, and I will instruct thee in this way in which thou shalt go; I will fix my eyes upon thee.
Nōlīte fierī sīcut equus et mūlus, quibus nōn est intellēctus. In cāmō et frēnō māxillās eōrum constringe, quī nōn approximant ad tē.^Do not become like the horse and the mule, who have no understanding. With bit and bridle bind fast their jaws, who come not near unto thee.
Multa flagella peccātōris; spērantem autem in Dominō misericordia circumdabit.^Many are the scourges of the sinner, but mercy shall encompass him that hopeth in the Lord.
Laetāminī in Dominō, et exsultāte, jūstī; et glōriāminī, omnēs rēctī corde.^Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye just; and glory, all ye right of heart.
