Domine probāstī mē, et cognōvistī mē.^Lord, thou hast proved me, and known me.
tū cognōvistī sessiōnem meam et resurrēctiōnem meam; intellēxistī cōgitātiōnēs meās dē longē.^Thou hast known my sitting down and my rising up; thou hast understood my thoughts afar off.
Sēmitam meam et fūniculum meum investīgāstī, et omnēs viās meās praevīdistī,^My path and my line thou hast searched out, and thou hast foreseen all my ways,
quia nōn est sermō in linguā meā.^for there is no speech in my tongue.
Ecce, Domine, tū cognōvistī omnia, novissima et antīqua; tū fōrmāstī mē, et posuistī super mē manum tuam.^Behold, O Lord, thou hast known all things, the last and those of old; thou hast formed me, and hast laid thy hand upon me.
Mīrābilis facta est scientia tua ex mē; confortāta est, et nōn poterō ad eam.^Thy knowledge is become wonderful to me; it is high, and I cannot reach to it.
Quō ībō ā Spīritū tuō? Et quō ā faciē tuā fugiam?^Whither shall I go from thy spirit? Or whither shall I flee from thy face?
Sī ascenderō in caelum, tū illic es; sī dēscenderō in infernum, ades.^If I ascend into heaven, thou art there; if I descend into hell, thou art present.
Sī sūmpserō pennās meās dīlūculō, et habitāverō in extrēmīs maris,^If I take my wings early in the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,
etenim illūc manus tua dēdūcet mē, et tenēbit mē dextera tua.^even there also shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.
Et dīxī: Forsitan tenebrae conculcābunt mē, et nox illūminātiō mea in dēliciīs meīs.^And I said: Perhaps darkness shall cover me, and night shall be my light in my pleasures.
Quia tenebrae nōn obscūrābuntur ā tē, et nox sīcut diēs illūminābitur; sīcut tenebrae ejus, ita et lūmen ejus.^But darkness shall not be dark to thee, and night shall be light all the day; for just as its darkness is, so also is its light.
Quia tū possēdistī rēnēs meōs; suscēpistī mē dē uterō mātris meae.^For thou hast possessed my reins; thou hast protected me from my mother's womb.
Confitēbor tibī, quia terribiliter magnificātus es; mīrābilia opera tua, et anima mea cognōscit nimis.^I will praise thee, for thou art fearfully magnified; wonderful are thy works, and my soul knoweth right well.
Nōn est occultātum os meum ā tē, quod fēcistī in occultō, et substantia mea in inferiōribus terrae.^My bone is not hidden from thee, which thou hast made in secret, and my substance in the lower parts of the earth.
Imperfectum meum vīdērunt oculī tuī, et in librō tuō omnēs scrībentur; diēs fōrmābuntur, et nēmō in eīs.^Thy eyes did see my imperfect being, and in thy book all shall be written; days shall be formed, and no one in them.
Mihī autem nimis honōrificātī sunt amīcī tuī, Deus; nimis confortātus est prīncipātūs eōrum.^But to me thy friends are made exceedingly honourable, O God; their principality is exceedingly strengthened.
Dīnumerābō eōs, et super arēnam multiplicābuntur; exsurrēxī, et adhūc sum tēcum.^I will number them, and they shall be multiplied above the sand; I rose up, and am still with thee.
Sī occīderīs, Deus, peccātōrēs; virī sanguinum, dēclīnāte ā mē,^If thou wilt kill the wicked, O God; ye men of blood, depart from me,
quia dīcitis in cōgitātiōne: Accipient in vānitāte cīvitātēs tuās.^because you say in thought: They shall receive thy cities in vain.
Nōnne quī ōdērunt tē, Domine, ōderam, et super inimīcōs tuōs tābēscēbam?^Have I not hated them, O Lord, that hated thee, and pined away because of thy enemies?
Perfectō odiō ōderam illōs, et inimīcī factī sunt mihī.^I have hated them with a perfect hatred, and they are become enemies to me.
Probā mē, Deus, et scītō cor meum; interrogā mē, et cognōsce sēmitās meās.^Prove me, O God, and know my heart; examine me, and know my paths.
Et vidē sī via inīquitātis in mē est, et dēdūc mē in viā aeternā.^And see whether the way of iniquity is in me, and lead me in the eternal way.
