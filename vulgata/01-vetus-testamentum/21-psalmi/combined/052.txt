Dīxit insapiens in corde suō: Nōn est Deus.^The fool said in his heart: There is no God.
Corruptī sunt, et abōminābilēs factī sunt in inīquitātibus; nōn est quī faciat bonum.^They are corrupted, and become abominable in iniquities; there is none that doth good.
Deus dē caelō prōspexit super fīliōs hominum, ut videat sī est intellegens, aut requīrens Deum.^God looked down from heaven on the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, or did seek God.
Omnēs dēclīnāvērunt; simul inūtilēs factī sunt; nōn est quī faciat bonum, nōn est usque ad ūnum.^All have gone aside; they are become unprofitable together; there is none that doth good, no not one.
Nōnne scient omnēs quī operantur inīquitātem, quī dēvorant plēbem meam ut cibum pānis?^Shall not all the workers of iniquity know, who eat up my people as they eat bread?
Deum nōn invocāvērunt; illīc trepidāvērunt timōre, ubī nōn erat timor. Quoniam Deus dissipāvit ossa eōrum quī hominibus placent; confūsī sunt, quoniam Deus sprēvit eōs.^They have not called upon God; there have they trembled for fear, where there was no fear. For God hath scattered the bones of them that please men; they have been confounded, because God hath despised them.
Quis dabit ex Siōn salūtāre Isrāhēl? Cum converterit Deus captīvitātem plēbis suae, exsultābit Jācōb, et laetābitur Isrāhēl.^Who will give out of Sion the salvation of Israel? when God shall bring back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
