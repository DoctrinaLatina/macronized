Domine, quis habitābit in tabernāculō tuō? Aut quis requiēscet in monte sanctō tuō?^Lord, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? or who shall rest in thy holy hill?
Quī ingreditur sine maculā et operātur jūstitiam, quī loquitur vēritātem in corde suō,^He who walketh without blemish and worketh justice, who speaketh truth in his heart,
quī nōn ēgit dolum in linguā suā, nec fēcit proximō suō malum, et opprobrium nōn accēpit adversus proximōs suōs.^who hath not used deceit in his tongue, nor hath done evil to his neighbour, and hath not taken up a reproach against his neighbours.
Ad nihilum dēductus est in conspectū ejus malignus; timentēs autem Dominum glōrificat. Quī jūrat proximō suō et nōn dēcipit,^In his sight the malignant is brought to nothing, but he glorifieth them that fear the Lord. He that sweareth to his neighbour and deceiveth not,
quī pecūniam suam nōn dedit ad ūsūram, et mūnera super innocentem nōn accēpit; quī facit haec, nōn movēbitur in aeternum.^he that hath not put out his money to usury, nor taken bribes against the innocent; he that doth these things, shall not be moved for ever.
