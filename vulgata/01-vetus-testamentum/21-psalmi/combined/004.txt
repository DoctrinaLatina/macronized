Cum invocārem exaudīvit mē Deus jūstitiae meae, in trībulātiōne dīlātāstī mihī. Miserēre meī, et exaudī ōrātiōnem meam.^When I called upon him, the God of my justice heard me, when I was in distress, thou hast enlarged me. Have mercy on me, and hear my prayer.
Fīliī hominum usquequo gravī corde? Ut quid dīligitis vānitātem, et quaeritis mendācium?^O ye sons of men, how long will you be dull of heart? why do you love vanity, and seek after lying?
Et scītōte quoniam mīrificāvit Dominus sānctum suum; Dominus exaudiet mē cum clāmāverō ad eum.^Know ye also that the Lord hath made his holy one wonderful; the Lord will hear me when I shall cry unto him.
Īrāsciminī, et nōlīte peccāre; quae dīcitis in cordibus vestrīs, in cubīlibus vestrīs compungiminī.^Be ye angry, and sin not; the things you say in your hearts, be sorry for them upon your beds.
Sacrificāte sacrificium jūstitiae, et spērāte in Dominō.^Offer up the sacrifice of justice, and trust in the Lord.
Multī dīcunt: Quis ostendit nōbīs bona? Signātum est super nōs lūmen vultūs tuī, Domine.^Many say: Who showeth us good things? The light of thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us.
Dedistī laetitiam in corde meō; ā frūctū frūmentī, vīnī, et oleī suī, multiplicātī sunt.^Thou hast given gladness in my heart; by the fruit of their corn, their wine, and oil, they are multiplied.
In pāce in idipsum dormiam, et requiēscam, quoniam tū, Domine, singulāriter in spē constituistī mē.^In peace in the self same I will sleep, and I will rest, for thou, O Lord, singularly hast settled me in hope.
