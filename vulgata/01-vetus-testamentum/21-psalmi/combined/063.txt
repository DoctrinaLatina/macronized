Exaudī Deus ōrātiōnem meam cum dēprecor; ā timōre inimīcī ēripe animam meam.^Hear O God, my prayer, when I make supplication to thee; deliver my soul from the fear of the enemy.
Prōtēxistī mē ā conventū malignantium, ā multitūdine operantium inīquitātem.^Thou hast protected me from the assembly of the malignant; from the multitude of the workers of iniquity.
Quia exacuērunt ut gladium linguās suās; intendērunt arcum rem amāram,^For they have whetted their tongues like a sword; they have bent their bow a bitter thing,
ut sagittent in occultīs immaculātum.^to shoot in secret the undefiled.
Subitō sagittābunt eum, et nōn timēbunt; firmāvērunt sibī sermōnem nēquam. Narrāvērunt ut absconderent laqueōs; dīxērunt: Quis vidēbit eōs?^They will shoot at him on a sudden, and will not fear; they are resolute in wickedness. They have talked of hiding snares; they have said: Who shall see them?
Scrūtātī sunt inīquitātēs; dēfēcērunt scrūtantēs scrūtiniō. Accēdet homō ad cor altum,^They have searched after iniquities; they have failed in their search. Man shall come to a deep heart,
et exaltābitur Deus. Sagittae parvulōrum factae sunt plāgae eōrum,^and God shall be exalted. The arrows of children are their wounds,
et infirmātae sunt contrā eōs linguae eōrum. Conturbātī sunt omnēs quī vidēbant eōs,^and their tongues against them are made weak. All that saw them were troubled,
et timuit omnis homō. Et adnuntiāvērunt opera Deī, et facta ejus intellēxērunt.^and every man was afraid. And they declared the works of God, and understood his doings.
Laetābitur jūstus in Dominō, et spērābit in eō, et laudābuntur omnēs rēctī corde.^The just shall rejoice in the Lord, and shall hope in him, and all the upright in heart shall be praised.
