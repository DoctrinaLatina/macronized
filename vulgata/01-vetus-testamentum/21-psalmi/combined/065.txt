psalmum dīcite nōminī ejus; date glōriam laudī ejus.^sing ye a psalm to his name; give glory to his praise.
Dīcite Deō: Quam terribilia sunt opera tua, Domine. In multitūdine virtūtis tuae mentientur tibī inimīcī tuī.^Say unto God, How terrible are thy works, O Lord! In the multitude of thy strength thy enemies shall lie to thee.

Quī dominātur in virtūte suā in aeternum; oculī ejus super gentēs respiciunt; quī exasperant nōn exaltentur in sēmet ipsīs.^Who by his power ruleth for ever: his eyes behold the nations; let not them that provoke him be exalted in themselves.
Benedīcite, gentēs, Deum nostrum, et audītam facite vōcem laudis ejus,^O bless our God, ye Gentiles, and make the voice of his praise to be heard,

Indūxistī nōs in laqueum; posuistī trībulātiōnēs in dorsō nostrō;^Thou hast brought us into a net; thou hast laid afflictions on our back;
imposuistī hominēs super capita nostra. Transīvimus per ignem et aquam, et ēdūxistī nōs in refrīgerium.^Thou hast set men over our heads. We have passed through fire and water, and thou hast brought us out into a refreshment.
Introībō in domum tuam in holocaustīs; reddam tibī vōta mea,^I will go into thy house with burnt offerings; I will pay thee my vows,
quae distīnxērunt labia mea, et locūtum est ōs meum in trībulātiōne meā.^which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken when I was in trouble.
Holocausta medullāta offeram tibī cum incensō arietum; offeram tibī bovēs cum hircīs.^I will offer up to thee holocausts full of marrow, with burnt offerings of rams; I will offer to thee bullocks with goats.
Venīte, audīte, et narrābō, omnēs quī timētis Deum, quanta fēcit animae meae.^Come, hear, and I will tell, all ye that fear God, what things he hath done for my soul.
