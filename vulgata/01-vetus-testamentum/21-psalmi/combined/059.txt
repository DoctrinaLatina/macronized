Deus, repulistī nōs, et dēstrūxistī nōs; īrātus es, et misertus es nōbīs.^O God, thou hast cast us off, and hast destroyed us; thou hast been angry, and hast had mercy on us.
Commōvistī terram, et conturbāstī eam; sānā contrītiōnēs ejus, quia commōta est.^Thou hast moved the earth, and hast troubled it; heal thou the breaches thereof, for it has been moved.
Ostendistī populō tuō dūra; pōtāstī nōs vīnō compūnctiōnis.^Thou hast shown thy people hard things; thou hast made us drink the wine of sorrow.
Dedistī metuentibus tē significātiōnem, ut fugiant ā faciē arcūs, ut libērentur dīlectī tuī.^Thou hast given a warning to them that fear thee, that they may flee from before the bow, that thy beloved may be delivered.
Salvum fac dexterā tuā, et exaudī mē.^Save me with thy right hand, and hear me.
Deus locūtus est in sanctō suō: Laetābor, et partiar Sichimam, et convallem tabernāculōrum mētiar.^God hath spoken in his holy place: I will rejoice, and I will divide Sichem, and will mete out the vale of tabernacles.
Meus est Galaad, et meus est Mānāssēs, et Efrāim fortitūdō capitis meī. Jūda rēx meus;^Galaad is mine, and Manasses is mine, and Ephraim is the strength of my head. Juda is my king;
Moab ōlla speī meae. In Idūmaeam extendam calceāmentum meum; mihī aliēnigenae subditī sunt.^Moab is the pot of my hope. Into Edom will I stretch out my shoe; to me the foreigners are made subject.
Quis dēdūcet mē in cīvitātem mūnītam? Quis dēdūcet mē usque in Idūmaeam?^Who will bring me into the strong city? Who will lead me into Edom?
Nōnne tū, Deus, quī repulistī nōs? Et nōn ēgrediēris Deus in virtūtibus nostrīs?^Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? And wilt not thou, O God, go out with our armies?
Dā nōbīs auxilium dē trībulātiōne, quia vāna salūs hominis.^Give us help from trouble, for vain is the salvation of man.
In Deō faciēmus virtūtem, et ipse ad nihilum dēdūcet trībulantēs nōs.^Through God we shall do mightily, and he shall bring to nothing them that afflict us.
