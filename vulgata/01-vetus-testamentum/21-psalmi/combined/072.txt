Quam bonus Isrāhel Deus hīs, quī rēctō sunt corde.^How good is God to Israel, to them that are of a right heart.
Meī autem paene mōtī sunt pedēs; paene effūsī sunt gressūs meī,^But my feet were almost moved; my steps had well nigh slipped,
quia zēlāvī super inīquōs, pācem peccātōrum videns,^because I had a zeal on occasion of the wicked, seeing the prosperity of sinners,
quia nōn est respectus mortī eōrum, et firmāmentum in plāgā eōrum.^for there is no regard to their death, nor is there strength in their scourge.
In labōre hominum nōn sunt, et cum hominibus nōn flagellābuntur.^They are not in the labour of men, neither shall they be scourged like other men.
Ideō tenuit eōs superbia; opertī sunt inīquitāte et impietāte suā.^Therefore pride hath held them fast; they are covered with their iniquity and their wickedness.
Prōdīvit quasi ex adipe inīquitās eōrum; transīvērunt in affectum cordis.^Their iniquity hath come forth as it were from fatness; they have passed into the affection of the heart.
Cōgitāvērunt et locūtī sunt nēquitiam; inīquitātem in excelsō locūtī sunt.^They have thought and spoken wickedness; they have spoken iniquity on high.
Posuērunt in caelum ōs suum, et lingua eōrum transīvit in terrā.^They have set their mouth against heaven, and their tongue hath passed through the earth.
Ideō convertētur populus meus hīc, et diēs plēnī invenientur in eīs.^Therefore will my people return here, and full days shall be found in them.
Et dīxērunt: Quōmodo scit Deus? Et sī est scientia in excelsō?^And they said: How doth God know? And is there knowledge in the most High?
Ecce ipsī peccātōrēs, et abundantēs in saeculō, obtinuērunt dīvitiās.^Behold these are sinners; and yet, abounding in the world they have obtained riches.
Et dīxī: Ergō sine causā jūstificāvī cor meum, et lāvī inter innocentēs manūs meās,^And I said: Then have I in vain justified my heart, and washed my hands among the innocent,
et fuī flagellātus tōtā diē, et castīgātiō mea in mātūtīnīs.^and I have been scourged all the day, and my chastisement hath been in the mornings.
Sī dīcēbam: Narrābō sīc; ecce nātiōnem fīliōrum tuōrum reprobāvī.^If I said: I will speak thus; behold I should condemn the generation of thy children.
Exīstimābam ut cognōscerem hoc, labor est ante mē,^I studied that I might know this thing, it is a labour in my sight,
dōnec intrem in Sanctuārium Deī, et intellegam in novissimīs eōrum.^until I go into the sanctuary of God, and understand concerning their last ends.
Vērumtamen propter dolōs posuistī eīs; dēiēcistī eōs dum allevārentur.^But indeed for deceits thou hast put it to them; when they were lifted up thou hast cast them down.
Quōmodo factī sunt in dēsōlātiōnem? Subitō dēfēcērunt; perīvērunt propter inīquitātem suam.^How are they brought to desolation? They have suddenly ceased to be; they have perished by reason of their iniquity.
Velut somnium surgentium, Domine, in cīvitāte tuā imāginem ipsōrum ad nihilum redigēs.^As the dream of them that awake, O Lord, in thy city thou shalt bring their image to nothing.
Quia inflammātum est cor meum, et rēnēs meī commūtātī sunt,^For my heart hath been inflamed, and my reins have been changed,
et ego ad nihilum redāctus sum, et nescīvī, ut jūmentum factus sum apud tē.^and I am brought to nothing, and I knew not, and I am become as a beast before thee.
Et ego semper tēcum; tenuistī manum dexteram meam,^And I am always with thee; thou hast held me by my right hand,
et in voluntāte tuā dēdūxistī mē, et cum glōriā suscēpistī mē.^and by thy will thou hast conducted me, and with thy glory thou hast received me.
Quid enim mihī est in caelō? Et ā tē quid voluī super terram?^For what have I in heaven? And besides thee what do I desire upon earth?
Dēfēcit carō mea et cor meum; Deus cordis meī, et pars mea Deus in aeternum.^For thee my flesh and my heart hath fainted away; thou art the God of my heart, and the God that is my portion for ever.
Quia ecce quī ēlongant sē ā tē perībunt; perdidistī omnēs quī fornicantur ā tē.^For behold they that go far from thee shall perish; thou hast destroyed all them that are disloyal to thee.
Mihī autem adhaerēre Deō bonum est, pōnere in Dominō Deō spem meam, ut adnuntiem omnēs praedicātiōnēs tuās in portīs fīliae Sīon.^But it is good for me to adhere to my God, to put my hope in the Lord God, that I may declare all thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion.
