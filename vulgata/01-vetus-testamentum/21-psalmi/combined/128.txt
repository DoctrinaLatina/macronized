Saepe expugnāvērunt mē ā juventūte meā, dīcat nunc Isrāhēl.^Often have they fought against me from my youth, let Israel now say.
Saepe expugnāvērunt mē ā juventūte meā; etenim nōn potuērunt mihī.^Often have they fought against me from my youth; but they could not prevail over me.
Suprā dorsum meum fabricāvērunt peccātōrēs; prolongāvērunt inīquitātem suam.^The wicked have wrought upon my back; they have lengthened their iniquity.
Dominus jūstus concīdit cervīcēs peccātōrum.^The Lord who is just will cut the necks of sinners.
Confundantur et convertantur retrōrsum omnēs, quī ōdērunt Sīon.^Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Sion.
Fīant sīcut foenum tēctōrum, quod priusquam ēvellātur exāruit,^Let them be as grass upon the tops of houses, which withereth before it be plucked up,
dē quō nōn implēvit manum suam quī metit, et sinum suum quī manipulōs colligit.^who with the mower filleth not his hand, nor he that gathereth sheaves his bosom.
Et nōn dīxērunt quī praeterībant: Benedictiō Dominī super vōs; benedīximus vōbīs in nōmine Dominī.^And they that passed by have not said: The blessing of the Lord be upon you; we have blessed you in the name of the Lord.
