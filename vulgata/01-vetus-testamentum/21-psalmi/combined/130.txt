Domine nōn est exaltātum cor meum, neque ēlātī sunt oculī meī, neque ambulāvī in magnīs, neque in mīrābilibus super mē.^Lord, my heart is not exalted, nor are my eyes lofty. Neither have I walked in great matters, nor in wonderful things above me.
Sī nōn humiliter sentiēbam, sed exaltāvī animam meam, sīcut ablactātus est super mātre suā, ita retribūtiō in animā meā.^If I was not humbly minded, but exalted my soul, as a child that is weaned is towards his mother, so reward in my soul.
Spēret Isrāhel in Dominō, ex hoc nunc et usque in saeculum.^Let Israel hope in the Lord, from henceforth now and for ever.
