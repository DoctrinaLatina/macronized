Salvum mē fac, Domine, quoniam dēfēcit sānctus, quoniam diminūtae sunt vēritātēs ā fīliīs hominum.^Save me, O Lord, for there is now no saint; truths are decayed from among the children of men.
Vāna locūtī sunt ūnusquisque ad proximum suum; labia dolōsa, in corde et corde locūtī sunt.^They have spoken vain things, every one to his neighbour; deceitful lips, in the heart and in the heart have they spoken.
Disperdat Dominus ūniversa labia dolōsa, et linguam magniloquam.^May the Lord destroy all deceitful lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things.
Quī dīxērunt: Linguam nostram magnificābimus; labia nostra ā nōbīs sunt. Quis noster Dominus est?^Who have said: We will magnify our tongue; our lips are our own. Who is Lord over us?
Propter miseriam inopum, et gemitum pauperum, nunc exsurgam, dīcit Dominus. Pōnam in salūtārī; fīdūciāliter agam in eō.^By reason of the misery of the needy, and the groans of the poor, now will I arise, saith the Lord. I will set him in safety; I will deal confidently in his regard.
Ēloquia Dominī, ēloquia casta; argentum igne exāminātum, probātum terrae, pūrgātum septuplum.^The words of the Lord are pure words; as silver tried by the fire, purged from the earth, refined seven times.
Tū, Domine, servābis nōs, et cūstōdiēs nōs ā generātiōne hāc in aeternum.^Thou, O Lord, wilt preserve us, and keep us from this generation for ever.
In circumitū impiī ambulant; secundum altitūdinem tuam multiplicāstī fīliōs hominum.^The wicked walk round about; according to thy highness thou hast multiplied the children of men.
