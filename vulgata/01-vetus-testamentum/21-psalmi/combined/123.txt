Nisi quia Dominus erat in nōbīs, dīcat nunc Isrāhel,^If it had not been that the Lord was with us, let Israel now say,
nisi quia Dominus erat in nōbīs, cum exsurgērent hominēs in nōs,^if it had not been that the Lord was with us, when men rose up against us,
forte vīvōs dēglūttīvissent nōs, cum īrāscerētur furor eōrum in nōs;^perhaps they had swallowed us up alive, when their fury was enkindled against us;
forsitan aqua absorbuisset nōs; torrentem pertransīvit anima nostra;^perhaps the water had swallowed us up; our soul hath passed through a torrent;
forsitan pertransīvisset anima nostra aquam intolerābilem.^perhaps our soul had passed through a water insupportable.
Benedictus Dominus, quī nōn dedit nōs, in captiōnem dentibus eōrum.^Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us to be a prey to their teeth.
Anima nostra sīcut passer ērepta est dē laqueō vēnantium; laqueus contrītus est, et nōs līberātī sumus.^Our soul like a sparrow hath been delivered from the snare of the hunters; the snare is broken, and we are delivered.
Adjūtōrium nostrum in nōmine Dominī, quī fēcit caelum et terram.^Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
