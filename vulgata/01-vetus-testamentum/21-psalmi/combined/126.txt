Nisi Dominus aedificāverit domum, in vānum labōrāvērunt quī aedificant eam. Nisi Dominus cūstōdīverit cīvitātem, frūstrā vigilat quī cūstōdit eam.^Unless the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it. Unless the Lord keep the city, he watcheth in vain that keepeth it.
Vānum est vōbīs ante lūcem surgere, surgite postquam sēderitis, quī mandūcātis pānem dolōris. Cum dederit dīlēctīs suīs somnum.^It is vain for you to rise before light, rise ye after you have sat down, you that eat the bread of sorrow. When he shall give sleep to his beloved.
Ecce hērēditās Dominī fīliī; mercēs, frūctus ventris.^Behold the inheritance of the Lord are children; the reward, the fruit of the womb.
Sīcut sagittae in manū potentis, ita fīliī excussōrum.^As arrows in the hand of the mighty, so the children of them that have been shaken.
Beātus vir quī implēvit dēsīderium suum ex ipsīs; nōn confundētur cum loquētur inimīcīs suīs in portā.^Blessed is the man that hath filled the desire with them; he shall not be confounded when he shall speak to his enemies in the gate.
