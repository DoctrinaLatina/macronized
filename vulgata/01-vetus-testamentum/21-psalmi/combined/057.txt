Sī vērē utique jūstitiam loquiminī, rēctā jūdicāte, fīliī hominum.^If in very deed ye speak justice, judge right things, ye sons of men.
Etenim in corde inīquitātēs operāminī; in terrā injūstitiās manūs vestrae concinnant.^For in your heart you work iniquity; your hands forge injustice in the earth.
Aliēnātī sunt peccātōrēs ā vulvā, errāvērunt ab uterō; locūtī sunt falsa.^The wicked are alienated from the womb; they have gone astray from the womb; they have spoken false things.
Furor illīs secundum similitūdinem serpentis, sīcut aspidis surdae et obtūrantīs aurēs suās,^Their madness is according to the likeness of a serpent, like the deaf asp that stoppeth her ears,
quae nōn exaudiet vōcem incantantium, et venēficī incantantis sapienter.^which will not hear the voice of those enchanting, nor of the wizard that charmeth wisely.
Deus conteret dentēs eōrum in ōre ipsōrum; molās leōnum confringet Dominus.^God shall break in pieces their teeth in their mouth; the Lord shall break the grinders of the lions.
Ad nihilum dēvenient tamquam aqua dēcurrēns; intendit arcum suum dōnec infirmentur.^They shall come to nothing, like water running down; he hath bent his bow till they be weakened.
Sīcut cēra quae fluit auferentur, supercecidit ignis, et nōn vīdērunt sōlem.^Like wax that melteth they shall be taken away, fire hath fallen on them, and they shall not see the sun.
Priusquam intellegerent spīnae vestrae rhamnum, sīcut vīventēs sīc in īrā absorbet eōs.^Before your thorns could know the brier, he swalloweth them up, as alive, in his wrath.
Laetābitur jūstus cum vīderit vindictam; manūs suās lavābit in sanguine peccātōris.^The just shall rejoice when he shall see the revenge; he shall wash his hands in the blood of the sinner.
Et dīcet homō: Sī utique est frūctūs jūstō, utique est Deus jūdicans eōs in terrā.^And man shall say: If indeed there be fruit to the just, there is indeed a God that judgeth them on the earth.
