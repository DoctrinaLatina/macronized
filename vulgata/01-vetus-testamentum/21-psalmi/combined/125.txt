In convertendō Dominus captīvitātem Sīon, factī sumus sīcut consōlātī.^When the Lord brought back the captivity of Sion, we became like men comforted.
Tunc replētum est gaudiō ōs nostrum, et lingua nostra exsultātiōne. Tunc dīcent inter gentēs: Magnificāvit Dominus facere cum eīs.^Then was our mouth filled with gladness, and our tongue with joy. Then shall they say among the Gentiles: The Lord hath done great things for them.
Magnificāvit Dominus facere nōbīscum; factī sumus laetantēs.^The Lord hath done great things for us; we are become joyful.
Converte, Domine, captīvitātem nostram, sīcut torrens in Austrō.^Turn again, O Lord, our captivity, as a stream in the south.
Quī sēminant in lacrimīs, in exsultātiōne metent.^They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
Euntēs ībant et flēbant, mittentēs sēmina sua.^Going they went and wept, casting their seeds.
Venientēs autem venient cum exsultātiōne, portantēs manipulōs suōs.^But coming they shall come with joyfulness, carrying their sheaves.
