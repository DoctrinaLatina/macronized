Ad tē levāvī oculōs meōs, quī habitās in caelīs.^To thee have I lifted up my eyes, who dwellest in heaven.
Ecce sīcut oculī servōrum in manibus dominōrum suōrum; sīcut oculī ancillae in manibus dominae suae, ita oculī nostrī ad Dominum Deum nostrum, dōnec misereātur nostrī.^Behold as the eyes of servants are on the hands of their masters; as the eyes of the handmaid are on the hands of her mistress, so are our eyes unto the Lord our God, until he have mercy on us.
Miserēre nostrī, Domine, miserēre nostrī, quia multum replētī sumus dēspectiōne.^Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on us, for we are greatly filled with contempt.
Quia multum replēta est anima nostra; opprobrium abundantibus, et dēspectiō superbīs.^For our soul is greatly filled; we are a reproach to the rich, and contempt to the proud.
