Ad Dominum cum trībulārer clāmāvī, et exaudīvit mē.^In my trouble I cried to the Lord, and he heard me.
Domine, līberā animam meam ā labiīs inīquīs et ā linguā dolōsā.^O Lord, deliver my soul from wicked lips and a deceitful tongue.
Quid dētur tibī, aut quid appōnātur tibī ad linguam dolōsam?^What shall be given to thee, or what shall be added to thee, to a deceitful tongue?
Sagittae potentis acūtae, cum carbōnibus dēsōlātōriīs.^The sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals that lay waste.
Heu mihī, quia incolātus meus prolongātus est. Habitāvī cum habitantibus Cēdar;^Woe is me, that my sojourning is prolonged. I have dwelt with the inhabitants of Cedar;
multum incola fuit anima mea.^my soul hath been long a sojourner.
Cum hīs quī ōdērunt pācem, eram pācificus; cum loquēbar illīs, impugnābant mē grātīs.^With them that hated peace I was peaceable; when I spoke to them, they fought against me without cause.
