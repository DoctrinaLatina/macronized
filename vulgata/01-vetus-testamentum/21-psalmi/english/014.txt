A psalm for David: Lord, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? or who shall rest in thy holy hill?
He who walketh without blemish and worketh justice, who speaketh truth in his heart,
who hath not used deceit in his tongue, nor hath done evil to his neighbour, and hath not taken up a reproach against his neighbours.
In his sight the malignant is brought to nothing, but he glorifieth them that fear the Lord. He that sweareth to his neighbour and deceiveth not,
he that hath not put out his money to usury, nor taken bribes against the innocent; he that doth these things, shall not be moved for ever.
