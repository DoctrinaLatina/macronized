A gradual canticle: Out of the depths I have cried to thee, O Lord.
Lord, hear my voice; let thy ears be attentive to the voice of my supplication.
If thou, O Lord, wilt mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand it?
For with thee there is merciful forgiveness.
By reason of thy law, I have waited for thee, O Lord; my soul hath relied on his word.
My soul hath hoped in the Lord from the morning watch even until night; let Israel hope in the Lord.
Because with the Lord there is mercy, and with him plentiful redemption.
And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
