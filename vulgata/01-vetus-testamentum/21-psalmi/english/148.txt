Alleluia: Praise ye the Lord from the heavens; praise ye him in the high places.
Praise ye him all his angels; praise ye him all his hosts.
Praise ye him, O sun and moon; praise him, all ye stars and light.
Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and thou water that art above the heavens.
Let them praise the name of the Lord; for he spoke, and they were made; he commanded, and they were created.
He hath established them for ever, and for ages of ages; he hath made a decree, and it shall not pass away.
Praise the Lord from the earth, ye dragons and all ye deeps,
fire, hail, snow, ice, wind of tempest, which fulfil his word,
mountains and all hills, fruitful trees and all cedars,
beasts and all cattle, serpents and feathered fowls,
kings of the earth and all people, princes and all judges of the earth,
young men and maidens, older with the younger;
let them praise the name of the Lord, for exalted is the name of him alone; the praise of him is above heaven and earth.
And he hath exalted the horn of his people; a hymn to all his saints, to the children of Israel, to a people drawing nigh unto him.
