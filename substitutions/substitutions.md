# Changes

## mihi/tibi/sibi/ibi/ubi
It appears that the final 'i' wasn't always short for these words; some uses would lengthen it. We will favor the long vowel ending in order to make pronunciation more "natural" and to find some common ground with modern ecclesiastical pronunciation.

mihi -> mihī
tibi -> tibī
sibi -> sibī
ibi -> ibī
ubi -> ubī

## amen
Favor short 'e' to align with pronunciation that became standardized in the first century.

āmēn -> āmen
