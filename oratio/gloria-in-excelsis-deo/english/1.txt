Glory to God in the highest,
and on earth peace to people of good will.
We praise thee,
we bless thee,
we adore thee,
we glorify thee,
we give thee thanks for thy great glory,
O Lord God, heavenly King,
O God almighty Father.
Lord, only begotten son, Jesus Christ,
Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of The Father,
thou takest away the sins of the world,
have mercy on us;
thou takest away the sins of the world,
receive our prayer;
thou art seated at the right hand of the Father
have mercy on us.
For thou alone art the Holy One,
thou alone art the Lord,
thou alone art the Most High,
Jesus Christ,
with the Holy Spirit,
in the glory of God the Father.
Amen.
